        <div class="row">
            <div class="mbr-article mbr-article--wysiwyg col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><p>The two phones that surpass the $900 price range. The Note 8 starting at $930 and the iPhone X starting at $999. Each have their pros and cons, but which one is better? I will be grading each phone on User Experiance, Raw Power, and Camera. Each phone can achieve 10 points in each category.</p><p>Starting with User Experiance, the Note 8 comes with TouchWiz, or samsungs stock android launcher. TouchWiz is suprisingly slow and performs worse on the American Note 8 compared to the International version. This is due to the fact that the International version runs on the Exynos Processor, compared the the Snapdragon processor on the American version. Along with a relativly slow UI, the samsung galaxy note 8 ships with lots of bloatware. Samsung has created an equivilant to every google app to ship with their phones. You wish it wouldn't get worse, but it can. If you do not buy the unlocked version, you will get plenty of carrier bloatware along with everything else, and if you get verizon, you have a locked bootloader. The final score for the Note 8 in user experiance is 4/10. On the plus side, the Note 8 (usually) does not come with a locked bootloader, allowing you to run a fresh install of android to remove all bloatware. The second pro, is how some bloatware can be disabled (not uninstalled) to reduce clutter in you app drawer. The final pro is in a way also a con. TouchWiz runs well enough to compare with the iPhone X springboard on the interntional version of the Note 8.&nbsp;</p><p>Now for the user experiance on the iPhone X. Running iOS 11, the iPhone X started on one of apples most unstable operating systems. This itself is a huge con, but if you decide to upgrade to the latest version (11.2.6 at the time of writing) your speed will exponentially increase. Another Pro is how both phones run apples A11 Bionic processor, which lead to no optimization issues. Finally, the last pro is how the phone ships with little to no bloatware. The reason I say this is because you can consider the stock apps as bloatware. (Just look at Maps, literal trash). The good news continues though becuase you can disable every stock app besides Photos, Camera, App Store, Settings, Safari, Phone, and Messages. On the cons the iPhone X's animations are suprisingly slow, compared to the Note 8. Finally, the iPhone X also lacks optimazation on many App Store apps, thus meaning the screen will look as it is running on an iPhone 8. In total the iPhone X gets a score of 7/10.</p><p>Moving on to raw power, the Note 8 comes with Qualcomms latest Snapdragon 835 Octa-Core processor. Geekbench shows a score on average of 2000 single core score and a 6400 multi core score. The score is the best avalible on an android phone, but the iPhone X scores higher. The Note 8 also comes with 6GB of RAM. I find this incredably useful to keep every app open. Theoretically this will keep you from having to save anything, as the app will stay open. (Even though most apps already autosave). The Note 8 also has 3 storage options, 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. 64GB is the starting price, which I find to be filled up very quickly. The phone would be much better if it started at 128GB, but at least this phone has a 128GB option. The iPhone X only has 64GB and 256GB. Finally Antutu Benchmark scores the Note 8 at 175,000. In total the Note 8 scores a 8/10.</p><p>Raw Power for the iPhone X is almost reversed. The iPhone X comes with Apples A11 Bionic Hexa-Core CPU. Don't let Hexa-Core decieve you though. The iPhone X scores 4240 on the single core score and 10,000 on the multi core score. Over 3000 points higher than the Note 8. The iPhone X however, comes with only 3GB of RAM. You are proably thinking, thats pretty similar, but 1GB makes the difference. On the Note 8, apps do not close almost ever, but I find myself recently re-opening apps on my iPhone X. Finally, the iPhone X does not offer many options in storage. You have underwhelming or 64GB, or overwhelming which is 256GB. A minor debuff against the iPhone X. Finally, the Antutu Benchmark scores for the iPhone X are 230,000. The iPhone X also comes in at an 8/10.</p><p>The last section is Camera. Each Phone has a dual camera module, and each camera has OIS and DIS. (Optical Image Stabilazation and Digital Image Stabilazation). Each camera also has two 12MP cameras, and both telephoto cameras have a f/2.4 apeture. The iPhone X however has a f/1.8 apeture on the main camera, where the Note 8 has an f/1.7 apeture. Each phone also has 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom. When video enters the equasion though, the balence turns. The iPhone X can record 4K 60fps video, while the Note 8 maxes out at 30fps. The Note 8 continues to lose its position when its slow motion video maxes out at 240fps 720p. The iPhone X however, continues forward with 240fps at 1080p. To switch over to the front camera the Note 8 wins. 7MP f/2.2 apeture on the iPhone X, and 8MP f/1.7 apeture on the Note 8. In total the Note 8 scores a 7/10 along with the iPhone X.</p><p>All in all the iPhone X scores slightly ahead of the Note 8, with a total score of 22/30, whereas the Note 8 scores a total of 19/30. This review however does not include special features, such as the S-Pen on the Note 8 and 3D Touch on the iPhone X. In conclusion the iPhone X scores 3 points more than the iPhone X.</p><p><br></p></div>
